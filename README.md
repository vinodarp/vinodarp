## About Me

I’m currently studying Business and recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I have a strong interest in technology and problem-solving, and I’ve developed practical skills through hands-on labs and personal projects.

My goal is to begin a career in IT or Cybersecurity, working in support roles where I can apply what I’ve learned and grow professionally while helping teams stay secure and productive.

## Here are some of the technical skills I’ve developed and applied through hands-on practice
